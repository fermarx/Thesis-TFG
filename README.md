# BThesis-TFG: Personal Climate Control System for Plants

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Bachelor's thesis project - a personal climate control system for plants in a personal greenhouse. The project aims to utilize the latest technologies in cloud computing and IoT to create a system that accurately monitors and controls the growing conditions of plants, making it easier for people to grow and care for their plants. The project received a grade of 9.5/10! ðŸŽ“

## Motivation
The project is driven by a passion for plants and gardening and a desire to find a solution to struggles with keeping plants alive. The goal is to improve the success rate of gardening by accurately monitoring and controlling growing conditions, making it easier for people to grow and care for their plants.

## Goals
The goals of the project were to:

* Design and implement a personal climate control system using IoT and cloud computing technologies
* Accurately monitor and control the growing conditions of plants in a personal greenhouse using the latest technologies in cloud computing and IoT
* Build a system using an Arduino board as the main controller, with temperature and light sensors placed in various locations throughout the growing area
* Provide a feedback mechanism for controlling environmental conditions based on data collected from the sensors
* Make the system easily expandable to allow for the addition of new sensors and devices as needed
* Provide detailed data and insights into the growing conditions to optimize the growth of plants and improve yields
* Create a system that is cost-effective and easy to use, using low-cost and widely available hardware components and open-source software
* Conduct a thorough analysis of the potential benefits and challenges of using cloud computing and IoT technology for personal gardening

## Technologies Used
The system was built using the following technologies:

* Arduino board as the main controller
* Temperature and light sensors
* Azure Portal and MySQL Server were used for cloud computing and IoT functionalities
* Python for communication

These technologies were essential in creating a personal climate control system for plants that accurately monitors and controls growing conditions in a personal greenhouse, and in providing detailed data and insights into the growing conditions to optimize plant growth and improve yields. Azure Portal and MySQL Server allowed us to leverage cloud computing and IoT technologies to build an efficient and cost-effective system.

## Usage
To use the system, the following steps should be followed:

* Set up the hardware components, including the Arduino board and sensors
* Connect the Arduino to the PC and upload the code to the board
* Set up the Azure functions for cloud computing
* Run the Python scripts to send and receive data from the system

## Conclusion
I am proud to have developed a practical and effective solution to the problem of keeping plants alive in a personal greenhouse. The project successfully achieved all its goals using IoT and cloud computing while managing to be cost-effective and easy to use. I acquired new knowledge throughout the project, particularly in the area of cloud services, which was a new area of study for me. The skills gained through the Bachelor's degree program were invaluable in developing this thesis, and I am excited to continue exploring new technologies and applying them to real-world problems. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to learn more about the project.
